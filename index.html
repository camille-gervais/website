      <h2>The Dream of a Ridiculous Man - Fiodor Dostoïevski</h2>
      <img src="images/images:le-reve.jpg" alt="Le Rêve d'un homme ridicule">
      <p>
         The story is told by an anonymous man, deeply depressed and convinced that his life is pointless. He plans to commit suicide, but before doing so, he falls asleep and has a dream that changes his perception of the world.

         In this dream, the man finds himself transported to a utopian planet, where the inhabitants live in perfect harmony, without sin, lies or violence. Their existence is marked by moral purity and inner peace. However, the arrival of this man leads to the corruption of this idyllic place: little by little, the planet's inhabitants begin to experience evil, and their paradise is transformed into a fallen version of Earth.

      <p>
        “Lady L.” is a novel by Romain Gary, published in 1958, which tells the fascinating and paradoxical story of Lady L., an 84-year-old English aristocrat who lives in worldly opulence in London. Yet behind her elegant, respectable exterior lies a tumultuous, passionate past.
        You are going to love this novel full of humor and criticisms about patriarchal society.

      <h2>Ignorance - Milan Kundera</h2>
      <img src="images/ignorance.jpeg" alt="L'Ignorance">
      <p>
        Milan Kundera's “Ignorance”, published in 2000, explores the themes of exile, memory and nostalgia through the story of Irena and Josef, two Czech migrants who, after many years abroad, return to their homeland after the fall of communism.

        The novel focuses on the complexity of the emotions involved in returning to a country that has changed, as well as on the idea of “great nostalgia”, the belief that a return to one's roots could bring happiness or inner peace. However, Kundera shows that this feeling is often an illusion. For Irena and Josef, returning to Czechoslovakia only underlines the strangeness of what was once familiar.
